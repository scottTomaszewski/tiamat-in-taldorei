# Umbrasyl

**The Hope Devourer**

> [!summary]
> `=this.summary`

Umbrasyl "The Hope Devourer" typically stays in his lair with the only exception being when he goes to hunt for food or when he accompanies a caravan twice a month to an unknown location and returns alone going straight to his lair. Due to his jet-black scales and the fact that he only leaves his lair at night, not much is known about his overall appearance other than a faint green glow around some of his body parts and that everywhere he goes ends up with pulls of acid throughout the area, as though it is constantly leaking from him. There have been quite a few instances of acid falling from the sky with the sound of beating wings, but nothing to be seen in the sky.

## Symbol of Umbrasyl

![[Umbrasyl Symbol.png|left]]

This is the symbol branded onto all that belong to Umbrasyl's Army, you would recognize it as the symbol of those that forced you to work in the work camp. It is only on those completely loyal to Umbrasyl and it is colored. You don't know anything about how it is applied only that it is on everyone that works for Umbrasyl.
